Workflow Description
--------------------

The TW files from the static calibration are:
 - UTIL_TRACE_TW for LW
 - UTIL_WAVE_TW for SW

In case of LW, cr2res_cal_wave needs to be skipped. The cr2res_cal_wave Composite Actor checks if UTIL_WAVE_TW is present as
input (SW case), if yes, it runs as normal, if no, it skips the recipe and returns an empty SOF (with the proper DatasetName <- Global parameter set in the Initialise Actor).

The following RecipeExecuters have 'Input File Category' set.
Therefore the list of values needs to be copied the new actor instance when re-instantiating.

    CAL_DARK_BPM CAL_DARK_MASTER CAL_FLAT_MASTER EMISSION_LINES UTIL_WAVE_TW WAVE_UNE WAVE_FPET
